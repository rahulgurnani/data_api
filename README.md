# data_api
This repository contains code for exploring Food permit data https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat. 
The requirements to run the project are present in requirements.txt. I have hosted this project currently at : https://cryptic-falls-87807.herokuapp.com/. 

I have used django framework for backend. I have also leveraged some django projects like django-filter (for providing search support) and django-background(for running cron job for auto expiry).
